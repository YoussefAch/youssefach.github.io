Time series decomposition is the process of uncovering predictable patterns in a time series. Imagine it as taking apart a complex machine to see all the individual pieces that make it work. This technique is a powerful tool in time series analysis because it helps extract the hidden components of the data, making it easier to understand what’s really going on. In this article, I’ll dive into what time series decomposition is, why it’s important, how it works, and how far its usefulness can go. By the end, you’ll see why this method is a must-have in any data scientist’s toolkit!
