I recently defended my Ph.D thesis in Machine Learning at Paris-Saclay University and Orange under a CIFRE Contract. I was supervised by <i>Antoine Cornu√©jols</i>, professor at AgroParistech, Paris-Saclay University and <i>Alexis Bondu</i>, research scientist at Orange Labs.

My Ph.D research is focused on early decision-making in online scenarios. When time series measurements are acquired over time, there can be situations with a trade-off between the earliness and accuracy of decisions. The issue facing the decision makers is that, usually, the longer the decision is delayed, the clearer is the likely outcome (e.g. the critical or not critical state of the patient) but, also, the higher the cost that will be incurred if only because earlier decisions allow one to be better prepared.

I am currently interested in deep generative models for graphs, and their extension to time series networks.
